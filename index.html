            <h2>RideCanada4MS Fairing</h2>
            <img src="media/ridecanada4ms.jpg" class="img-inline">
            <p>
              We were tasked by <a href="https://rc4ms.org">RideCanada4MS</a>, a charity aiming to raise Â£1,000,000 for multiple sclerosis (MS) research to develop measures to improve the efficiency of a recumbent trike.
              Over three months, through consultation sessions with the client and after several design reviews, a rear fairing was decided as the best approach with a maximum weight of 1kg.
              Lightweighting initiatives for mounts and fixtures were also done.
            </p>
            <p>
              My role included overseeing the design and manufacturing of the fairing by ensuring performance and H&S requirements were met.
              One of the major decisions I had to make was on the layup process. 
              Since the finished product had to be light, pre-pregnated carbon fibre laminate (prepreg) was the choice we decided to go with.
              This involved custom moulds that had to be manufactured with a glass fibre-matrix compound due to its resistance to high temperatures.
              In the end, we were able to achieve a total weight of ~400 grams, 60% lower than the target mass.
            </p>
            <p>
              The RideCanada4MS journey has been covered on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn8vv06x18wo">BBC</a>.

              Contributed to the development of a 3.2 meter wingspan vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone capable of transitioning into horizontal flight as Lead Structural Design Engineer.
              <a href="https://www.projecthex.co.uk">Vulcan V3</a> was designed for the <a href="https://suas-competition.org/">SUAS 2024</a> competition which took place in Maryland, USA. 
              The drone was designed to have a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 20kg with the capability of flying over 5 miles at a minimum altitude of 100 ft.
              <span></span>
              Significant breakthroughs that I was involved in included:
              <ul>
                <li>New carbon fibre composite (CF) monocoque fuselage and CF foam core wings which reduced mass by 20%, and</li>

            <h2>250 Watt Gearbox</h2>
            <img src="media/gearbox.jpg" class="img-inline">
            <p>
              Led a team to design a gearbox for accelerating a bike up to 15mph / 24.94kph with a maximum power consumption of 250W, in accordance with 
              <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electrically-assisted-pedal-cycles-eapcs/electrically-assisted-pedal-cycles-eapcs-in-great-britain-information-sheet">EAPC UK regulations</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This included calculations, designing and FEA simulations on the gears, bearing assembly and motor mount.
              After iterating and prototyping on our CAD design, the components were finally manufactured by laser-cutting out of 600x400 3mm acrylic. 
              The product was then assembled with M8 nuts, threaded rods, and self-lubricated bearings and completed by attaching a sprocket assembly. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To address the complex assembly, design for ease of assembly was made one of the key criteria from the start.
              A similar approach was made when exploring mounting methods and optimising the gearbox for maximum power. 
              As a result, this allowed us to position top 1% in the cohort on overall efficiency.
