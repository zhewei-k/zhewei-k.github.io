            <p>
              Hi! I'm Zhe-Wei. I'm an MSc Composites student at the ✈️Department of Aeronautics of Imperial College London.
              I'm now at Imperial after completing my BEng in Mechanical Engineering at University of Sheffield.
              <span></span>
              I have developed a keen interest in understanding more about the application of lightweight structures and metamaterials.
              My experience includes developing solutions for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and optimising additively manufactured titanium triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures.
              <span></span>
              With eVTOL aircraft, I've co-led the design of a 3.2-meter wingspan carbon fibre (CF) composite drone, comprised of a monocoque CF fuselage, foam-core CF aero surfaces, and a 20-meter payload deployment system.
              With additively manufactured TPMS structures, I've automated the optimisation process for orthopaedic implants, with potential of savings of over £2 billion pounds for the NHS if implemented.
              <span></span>
              As a strong advocator for making STEM education more accessible, I am interested in empowering just the leaders of tomorrow, but everyone, no matter their background, is able to find success in their life.

            <p>
              Porous scaffolds are applicable to many areas, from crash structures to medical implants, achieving the desired mechanical properties is a fine balance.
              Three out of every ten patients face complications in the 25 years after surgery in the UK <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30782341/">[1]</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30782340/">[2]</a>.
              In fact, younger patients have a 3-5 time higher risk <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28209371/">[3]</a>.
              <span></span>
              As a result, it is important to automate the manual, expensive, and slow optimisation process additively manufactured titanium porous scaffolds.
              <span></span>
              Methodology:
              <ul>
                <li>Model using nTop Automate 5.16.2</li>
                <li>Analyse scaffold using Ansys Mechanical 2024 R2 via PyMAPDL 0.68.2</li>
                <li>Optimise using secant numerical method</li>
                <li>Export data using custom Python logger</li>
                <li>Visualise using MATLAB</li>
              </ul>
              Porous scaffolds for each specified stiffness were optimised in around 15 minutes.
              Findings also included the effect of cell configuration on stiffness.

              We were tasked by <a href="https://rc4ms.org">RideCanada4MS</a>, a charity aiming to raise £1,000,000 for multiple sclerosis (MS) research to develop measures to improve the efficiency of a recumbent trike.
              Over three months, through consultation sessions with the client and after several design reviews, a rear fairing was decided as the best approach with a maximum weight of 1kg.
              Lightweighting initiatives for mounts and fixtures were also done.
              <span></span>
              My role included overseeing the design and manufacturing of the fairing by ensuring performance and H&S requirements were met.
              One of the major decisions I had to make was on the layup process. 
              Since the finished product had to be light, pre-pregnated carbon fibre laminate (prepreg) was the choice we decided to go with.
              This involved custom moulds that had to be manufactured with a glass fibre-matrix compound due to its resistance to high temperatures.
              In the end, we were able to achieve a total weight of ~400 grams, 60% lower than the target mass.
              <span></span>

              Led a team to design a gearbox for accelerating a bike up to 15mph / 24.94kph with a maximum power consumption of 250W, in accordance with 
              <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electrically-assisted-pedal-cycles-eapcs/electrically-assisted-pedal-cycles-eapcs-in-great-britain-information-sheet">EAPC UK regulations</a>.
              <span></span>
              This included calculations, designing and FEA simulations on the gears, bearing assembly and motor mount.
              After iterating and prototyping on our CAD design, the components were finally manufactured by laser-cutting out of 600x400 3mm acrylic. 
              The product was then assembled with M8 nuts, threaded rods, and self-lubricated bearings and completed by attaching a sprocket assembly. 
              <span></span>
              To address the complex assembly, design for ease of assembly was made one of the key criteria from the start.
              A similar approach was made when exploring mounting methods and optimising the gearbox for maximum power. 
              As a result, this allowed us to position top 1% in the cohort on overall efficiency.
